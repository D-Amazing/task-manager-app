# Task Manager App

This is my very first task management app built with React and TypeScript. I used a React baseline and learned how to implement authentication and authorization using Auth0 for the first time.

## About This Project

- This project helped me learn how to connect frontend React apps to authentication APIs.
- I built a simple dashboard where users can create, update, and manage tasks after logging in.
- Itâ€™s a hands-on introduction to using Auth0 for user login/logout flows and securing parts of the app.
- I also practiced using React Context API and typed hooks to keep the code clean and safe.

## Features

- User sign-up, login, and logout powered by Auth0
- Create, update, and delete tasks
- Dashboard showing task list and details
- Basic error handling
- Responsive design with a nice background image
